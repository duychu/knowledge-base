```
npm install -g yarn
npm install -g yo generator-theia-extension
mkdir theia-dcnf-ide
cd theia-dcnf-ide
yo theia-extension # select the 'Hello World' option and complete the prompts
```

You will below structure that generated by yo. Since we are going to build browser app, we will remove electron-app folder.

```
